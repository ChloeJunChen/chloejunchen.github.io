            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Modern grocery stores often struggle with customer satisfaction due to issues like overcrowded areas and difficulty in locating staff for assistance. These challenges disrupt the shopping experience, making it stressful and time-consuming for customers. This project aimed to design an embodied solution to address these pain points.</p>
