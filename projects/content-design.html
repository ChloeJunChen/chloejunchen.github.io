                    Drive tourism is about freedom, exploration, and discovery, but traditional guided tours often fail to meet the needs of self-drive travelers who value flexibility and spontaneity. Audio guides, with their hands-free adaptability, are ideal for road trips but often lack content tailored to the journey’s context—whether it’s iconic sites, bustling cities, or expansive states. This study leverages schema theory to design intuitive, engaging audio guides that align with how travelers think, enhancing the road trip experience and making it more seamless and memorable.

                        <h3>Drive Tourism</h3>
                        <p>Unlike traditional guided tours with fixed schedules and group activities, drive tourism emphasizes freedom, flexibility, and self-directed exploration. Travelers navigate their journey by car, choosing where to stop, what to explore, and how long to stay. This travel style highlights the need for tools that provide tailored, adaptable information to enhance the experience.</p>
